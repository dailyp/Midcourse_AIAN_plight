Crisis of American Indian/Alaskan Native Missing and Murdered Women and Girls

This exercise explores the incidence of violent deaths among American Indian and Alaskan
Native (AIAN) women and girls compared to the rest of the female US population. While the 
intent of the exercise was to also study the number of missing women and girls of this 
population compared to the rest of the U.S. female population, the limited data from 
government agencies by gender resulted in a review of missing persons amongst all genders, 
rather than just female. 

Savanna’s Act, signed into law in October of 2020, directs the DOJ to review, revise, and 
develop law enforcement and justice protocols to address missing or murdered Native 
Americans. Among the provisions of the bill are the requirement of the DOJ to annually report 
statistics on missing or murdered Native Americans, and to break down the data by gender
(congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/227). The requirements of the bill reflect the 
expected inherent challenges related to the data: that it is extremely disparate, 
underreported, and potentially fraught with errors.

The goal for the app is to cull data to identify any trends, and to highlight where data is lacking. 
The app also includes geolocation of violent deaths and missing data for the AIAN female 
gender in the U.S. as compared to another map that shows where the AIAN population resides 
in the U.S.

Data Question
1. Is the incidence rate of missing and/or violent deaths among Native American and 
Alaskan Native women and girls disproportionately higher than other US female races? 
2. Are there any trends related to the murdered or missing women and girls?
3. And what data is glaringly missing? 

Data Sources
The following data sources were used in development of the app and accompanying powerpoint presentation.

used for the population comparison by Race and merged with the NCIC Missing data for

Missing data lumped Hispanics with Whites; therefore, a data pull for Whites from the 
CDC site included Hispanics.
